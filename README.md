# Machine-Learning-Models

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Models**, a curated collection of beginner-to-intermediate level ML classification and regression projects made by me. Each folder contains a self-contained project complete with dataset handling, model training, evaluation, and results visualization.

## 🔍 Included Projects

### 🏠 House Price Prediction
Predicts house prices based on features using regression (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso).

➡️ [View README](./House%20Price%20Prediction/README.md)

---

### 🌸 IRIS Flower Classifier
Classic ML dataset for **multi-class classification** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using SVM.

➡️ [View README](./IRIS%20Classification/README.md)

---

### 🍄 Mushroom Classifier
Classifies mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** based on categorical attributes. Trained using:
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest  
> Best Models: **Random Forest** and **KNN** (Accuracy: 100%)

➡️ [View README](./Mushroom%20Classifier/README.md)
