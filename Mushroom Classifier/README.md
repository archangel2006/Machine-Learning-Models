# üçÑ Mushroom Classification ‚Äì Edible or Poisonous?

(Date: July 27, 2025)

This project builds and compares multiple classification models to determine whether a mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** based on its features. The dataset is processed and evaluated using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest** classifiers. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to compare model performance.

## üìå Objective  
To classify mushrooms as **edible (e)** or **poisonous (p)** based on their categorical features. The goal is to build a robust model that generalizes well and can assist in safe mushroom identification.

## üìÇ Dataset  
**Source:** [UCI Mushroom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)  
**Target Variable:** `class` (e = edible, p = poisonous)

**Features (after encoding):**
- cap-shape
- cap-surface
- cap-color
- bruises
- odor
- gill-attachment
- gill-spacing
- gill-size
- gill-color  
*(+ several more, total 22 features after encoding)*

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked shape, data types, null values (none found).
- Examined class distribution ‚Äì fairly balanced.
- Analyzed frequency of each feature's unique values.
- Visualized correlation between selected categorical features and class.
- Inspected label distribution with bar plots.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing  
- Label encoding applied to all categorical variables.
- Train-test split using `train_test_split` (test size = 20%).
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler` (for KNN & Logistic Regression).
- All models trained on the same preprocessed data for fair comparison.
